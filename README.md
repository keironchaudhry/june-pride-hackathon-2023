## **Project Goals**

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon June 2023 Theme of "Pride", create an application which follows the theme of LGBTQ+ Pride. The application should be meaningful and educative, and bring purpose and connection to the user.

## **User Experience**

Connect+ prioritises delivering a seamless and delightful user experience to ensure that our application is accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable for everyone in the LGBTQ+ community.

* **LGBTQ+ Podcast**: The application features a testimonials page where users can engage in stories and experiences as told by other people of the same community. The user is able to emotionally connect and recognise their experiences in these testimonials.

* **Milestones**: It also features an educational page where users can be exposed to current/historical figures that have had a monumental impact in the community or in history. Featured also are historical events. 

* **Conversation**: The application features a game which has been designed to produce random questions for the user. This game is to intuitively be used in person with another person, as a way of getting to know them at a deeper, human level. 

## **Target Audience**

Our target audience is everybody that is a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and even those who are allies, thus being able to educate themselves and learn about LGBTQ+ community by having exposure to the history and struggles in this domain.

## **User Stories**

As a **user**, I want **to be able to view a consistent colour scheme across the application** so that **the application and its navigation feels like a smooth transition**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to find and access the navigation bar** so that I can **navigate around the application with ease**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to view the footer** so that I can **view any extra beneficial information regarding the application**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to land on the home page** so that I am **able to have a central point of contact in the application**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to find a question game** so that I can **play it in person with another stranger to get to know them better**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to listen to different podcasts** so that I can **engage and associate with the experiences of others**.

As a **user**, I want **to be able to view historical information** so that I can **learn and appreciate LGBTQ+ history**.



## **Design**
With a focus on minimalism and contemporary aesthetics, we made a deliberate choice to steer away from the conventional pride color scheme. Our aim was to avoid any over-the-top elements commonly associated with the LGBTQ+ community. Nevertheless, we incorporated a vibrant palette reminiscent of the colors of the pride rainbow, but with reduced opacity to ensure that unnecessary content doesn't distract attention.

Other details to note:
- The portraits featured on the Testimonials page were generated using Midjourney.
- Other visuals were obtained from reputable image stock databases such as Pexels and Envato.

### **Design Choices**

To be added.

### **Colour**
In designing the website, we made a deliberate choice to incorporate a vibrant color palette. However, we were keen on avoiding the stereotypical kitschy pride colors and instead aimed for a fresh and unique approach. To maintain a harmonious visual experience, we also decreased the opacity of the colors, ensuring a balanced and pleasing aesthetic without overwhelming or conflicting color clashes.

### **Fonts**

To be added.

### **Music & Sounds**
In order to provide an exceptional user experience and offer a realistic preview of the website's functionality, we took steps to create an immersive audio experience. For each story, we generated podcasts featuring diverse voices. These voices were recorded using specialized AI software that seamlessly converts text into speech. The audio content for each testimonial was generated using ChatGPT, where we selectively prompted the stories we wished to share.
