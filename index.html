She is wearing a black coat and dark shoes, and her hair is pulled back in a bun. In her left hand she holds a microphone, while her right arm rests on the bench beside her. Behind her stands an imposing glass wall with several windows that are partially open. The street behind the woman has been recently paved, and there are two waste containers at either side of the road. The sky above is grey and cloudy, adding to the somber atmosphere of this scene."/>

The man on the left is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, while the man on the right is wearing a black t-shirt and grey pants. Both of them have their arms resting on the armrests of their respective chairs. Behind them is an outdoor seating area with several other chairs, as well as some tables and plants. To their right is a green door leading into what appears to be an indoor shop or restaurant, with large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Above this entrance hangs a sign with bright yellow lettering spelling out 'U'. In front of them lies a grey pavement surface which has been decorated with various patterns and shapes in red paint."/>

She has her hands in her pockets, and she looks to be deep in thought as she strides along. The sign above the store reads "Welcome" with an arrow pointing towards the entrance. Behind her, there is a wall covered with graffiti art that adds some color to the otherwise grey scene. On the ground below her feet is a grey carpet that stretches out into the distance. In front of her, there is a mirror reflecting back at herself as she continues down this street." />
